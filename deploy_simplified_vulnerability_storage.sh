echo "🔧 What was simplified:"
echo "- ❌ Removed confidence_score field completely"
echo "- ✅ Kept is_validated field (defaults to TRUE)"
echo "- ✅ Kept template_name, cvss_score, asset_metadata"
echo "- ✅ Simple validation: critical/high/medium = auto-validated"
echo "- ✅ Low/info severity = stored for manual review"
echo ""
echo "🎯 Benefits:"
echo "- No more 'confidence_score is an invalid keyword' errors"
echo "- Simpler vulnerability storage logic"
echo "- All vulnerabilities are stored successfully"
echo "- Faster Nuclei scans (conservative parameters)"
echo ""
echo "🧪 Test by running a new Nuclei scan:"
echo "- Should store ALL vulnerabilities without errors"
echo "- Critical/High/Medium will be auto-validated"
echo "- Low/Info will be marked for manual review"
